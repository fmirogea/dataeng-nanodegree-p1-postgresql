# Project: Data Modeling with Postgres
This is Project 1: Data Modeling with PostgreSQL, part of Udacity's Nanodegree in Data Engineering 

## Project Description
The goal of the project is by using the song and log datasets, creating a data model (based on a star schema) optimized for queries on song play analysis. 
Discuss the purpose of this database in the context of the startup, Sparkify, and their analytical goals.

## Running the scripts
How to run the Python scripts:

Run create_tables.py to create your database and tables.
Run etl.py to run the ETL pipeline.

## File descriptions
An explanation of the files in the repository

## Database schema and ETL pipeline design
State and justify your database schema design and ETL pipeline.
